blendertheme
============

Hi this is Twilight Blender theme. It's focus mainly to make blender more sleek and ease to the eyes. The Development still going on, but I would rather freeze it for now and wait for user feedback. I put along my startup blend file that consist of compositing V2 layout that often I use in my workflow. Hope you find this theme useful.

I put the stable version of this theme on release folder https://github.com/aditiapratama/blendertheme/tree/master/release.
